# 🌐 Personal Sites Collection

Welcome to my **Personal Websites Repository**, showcasing my work as a **Full-Stack Developer**.  
This repository contains personal website projects that demonstrate my **front-end** and **back-end** skills.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I build both the **front-end** interfaces and **back-end** functionality for personal projects, combining them to create complete web applications.  

## 📂 Structure
This repository is organized by language:

- `en/` → Personal websites in **English**
- `fa/` → Personal websites in **Persian**

Projects may include **static sites, dynamic back-end apps, or full-stack applications**.

## 📌 How to Use
- Browse the projects folder by folder
- Check individual README files for project-specific info
- New projects will be added gradually
